# OrderDW Sales Analytics

A MySQL-based Sales Data Warehouse project built using a star schema design. This project includes the full schema setup, ETL stored procedures, sample data, and analytical queries for reporting purposes.

---

## üìä Project Overview

**OrderDW** is a dimensional data warehouse designed to support analytical queries on sales data. It includes:

- Star schema with dimension and fact tables
- Stored procedures for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Triggers and audit logs for change tracking
- Sample data for testing
- Views for simplified reporting
- Predefined analytical queries

---

## üß± Schema Design

The data warehouse follows a star schema:

- **Fact Table:**
  - `FactOrderLines`: Central table storing order line measures
- **Dimension Tables:**
  - `DimDate`: Date attributes
  - `DimCustomer`: Customer info
  - `DimProduct`: Product catalog
  - `DimLocation`: Shipping locations
  - `DimShipper`: Shipping providers

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Execution Order

Execute the SQL files in this order:

1. `01_dw_schema_and_audit.sql`  
   ‚§∑ Creates database schema, dimension/fact tables, and audit log with triggers.

2. `02_etl_procedures_and_views.sql`  
   ‚§∑ Defines stored procedures for populating dimensions and fact tables. Also includes a reporting view.

3. `03_sample_data_population.sql`  
   ‚§∑ Inserts mock data into all dimension and fact tables.

4. `04_procedure_call_examples.sql`  
   ‚§∑ Example usage of stored procedures for ETL-like operations.

5. `05_sample_reporting_queries.sql`  
   ‚§∑ Ready-to-run queries for analysis: sales trends, top products, customer segmentation, etc.
